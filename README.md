# Kuylar.DSharpPlus.SlashCommands

> You must use the nightly versions of DSharpPlus to use this package. See: https://dsharpplus.github.io/articles/misc/nightly_builds.html

**Dependency Injection DOES NOT WORK in the current version of this library. You can set the services, but they won't do anything**

This is a "better" replacement for the current DSharpPlus. [The same documentation](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus/blob/master/DSharpPlus.SlashCommands/README.md) will also apply to this extension.
